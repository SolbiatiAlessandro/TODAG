I got super high billing for some misterious bugs reason that made my service being used 24/7 so I am restarting the gcloud project.
I am taking this opportunity to rethink the app design.

1. Do I keep pickle on GCS or I open SQL?
2. Do I keep stackdriver for datamonitor? 

Looks like TODAG will be offline, just run locally.

1. pickle not a problem
2. all data stored locally? mmm
3. no stackdriver
4. google calendar api ok

Note on why offline:
-> too much overhead for the cloud, especially figure out how to pay less
-> learnt a lot on how to build on cloud will be useful for next proj
-> relna will be abandoned, todag can be done completely offline (without google cloud)
