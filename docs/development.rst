- gamification: rewards to be considered as gems with higher and higher value, and to get the next gem the game become more difficult ('game of life?'), cfr. Ray Dalio Principles cap. 8, he speaks about this concept
- priority: every reward has a priority and I print the todos in order of the priority of their own reward, the idea is that I need to have tons of reward and when I want to do something I just iterates on the todos
- weight: every reward has a weight (not a priority), and the weight of the todo is the some of all the weight of all the rewards card it leads to
